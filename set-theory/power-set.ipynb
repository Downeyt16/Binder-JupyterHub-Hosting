    "The power set is a set of all subsets of a set. It includes the null set $\\varnothing$ and also the set itself. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "The power set of a set $A$ is denoted by $\\mathcal{P}$(A). <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $B = \\{0,1\\}$, the set of binary digits. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Its power set $P(B)$ is all possible subsets including the null set $\\emptyset$ and $B$ itself. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{P}(B) = \\{\\emptyset,\\{0\\},\\{1\\},\\{0,1\\}\\}$ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the elements of the power set are themselves sets. Therefore, the power set is a set of sets.<br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A = \\{a,b,c\\}$ be a set. Its power set is all possible subsets including the null set $\\emptyset$ and $A$ itself. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{P}(A) = \\{\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{b\\},\\{c\\},\\{a,b\\},\\{a,c\\},\\{b,c\\},\\{a,b,c\\}\\}$ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We systematically enumerate subsets of cardinality $0,1,2 \\text { and } 3$. Recall that cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorem: Let $A$ be a finite set with $|A|=n$. Then, the number of sets in its power set $\\mathcal{P}(A)$ is $2^{n}$. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be proved by induction on the number of elements of $A$. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Base case: </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When $n=0$ and $|A|=0$ clearly, $A = \\emptyset$ <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "That is, the number of subsets of $A= 2^{n}$ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $B = A \\cup \\{a\\}$. That is, create a set $B$ which has all the elements of $A$ and one additional element $a$. Therefore, $|B| = n+1$  <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider all the subsets of $B$. There are two kinds : <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Those that are in $A$ (which do not include the new element $a$), and those that are in $A$ but include the new element $a$. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, numbers of subsets of $B$ equals those that are in $A$ plus those that are in $A$ plus the new element $a$.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$= 2^{n}$ (by induction hypothesis) + $2^{n}$ (there are same subsets of $A$, but each susbsets now has a new element attached.) <br>\n",

    "$\\mathcal{P}(B) = 2^{n} + 2^{n} = 2.2^{n} = 2^{n+1}$ <br>\n",
